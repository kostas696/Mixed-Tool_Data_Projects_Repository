# Tracking User Engagement with SQL, Excel, and Python


## **Overview:**
This project focuses on analyzing user engagement within an online learning platform. Leveraging a real dataset, we investigate whether recent platform enhancements, including the introduction of new courses, exams, and career tracks, have positively impacted student engagement. The dataset includes key information such as:

Holder (student ID) and issuance date of certificates issued in Q2 2022
Student ID and registration date of students who registered between January 1, 2020, and June 30, 2022
Student ID, product type, purchase date, and refund date (if applicable) of purchases made between January 1, 2020, and June 30, 2022
Student watching (student ID), time watched, and date of courses watched in Q2 2021 and Q2 2022
All necessary precautions have been taken to limit the dataset's volume and protect customer privacy.

## **Hypothesis**:
We hypothesized that the first half of 2022 would prove profitable due to the release of several new features on our website. These features include the ability to enroll in career tracks, test knowledge through practice, course, and career track exams, and an expanded course library. Our aim was to increase user engagement and grow the platform's audience by covering a broader range of topics. To measure the effectiveness of these new features and overall user engagement, we compare various metrics.

## **Project Structure**:
The project can be divided into several phases, including data collection, data preprocessing, analysis using SQL, Excel, and Python, and interpretation of results. Detailed descriptions of each phase can be found in the respective project directories.

## **Results and Conclusions**:
Our analysis yielded valuable insights into user engagement, offering a comprehensive understanding of the impact of recent platform enhancements. Key findings and conclusions are available in the project results.

## **Limitations**:
It's important to note that the analysis is based on the available dataset, which has inherent limitations, such as data volume and privacy considerations. Additionally, certain assumptions were made during the analysis.

## **Future Work**:
Potential future work may involve exploring additional questions related to user engagement, expanding the dataset, or improving the analysis methodology.
