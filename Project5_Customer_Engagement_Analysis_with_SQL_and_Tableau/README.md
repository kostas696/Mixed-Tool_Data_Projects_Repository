*Customer Engagement Analysis Project*

Overview
Welcome to our Customer Engagement Analysis project, where we explore student engagement with the 365 platform and identify areas for improvement. 
The goal is to build a three-page dashboard with key metrics and visualizations that address specific questions related to student engagement.

Project Objectives
The primary objectives of our dashboard are to answer the following questions:

- Top Courses:

Identify the most-watched courses by students.
Evaluate the ratings of these courses.

- Monthly Registration and Onboarding:

Analyze the number of students registering each month.
Determine the fraction of registered students who are also onboarded.

- Student Engagement by Type:

Explore how students engage with the platform based on their type (free-plan or paying).
Examine minutes watched and average minutes watched for each type.

- Content Consumption Over Time:

Investigate if students watch more content over time.
Analyze seasonal variations in content consumption.

- International Engagement:

Identify countries with the highest number of registered students.
Assess whether registration numbers correlate with minutes watched per country.
