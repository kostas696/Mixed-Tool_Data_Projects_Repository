# Checkout Optimization Project

## Overview
In this project, I took part in a practical, real-world case aimed at optimizing the checkout flow of an online platform.
My analysis focused on enhancing the purchase experience for users on the 365 webpage—a crucial aspect of online retail affecting conversion rates and customer satisfaction.
By exploring an actual database, uncovering crucial insights, and building a comprehensive dashboard, I gained practical experience in improving the website's purchase checkout system.

## Objective
I created a three-page story-based dashboard from scratch to analyze the 365 platform’s checkout process. The dashboard displayed key metrics, insights, and visualizations covering the period from 07-01-2022 to 01-31-2023.
The final Tableau story aided in drawing conclusions and suggesting potential enhancements.

## User Interaction Categories
- **Successful Checkout**: Users completing payments for subscriptions without issues.
- **Failed Checkout**: Users encountering problems while paying and unable to complete transactions.
- **Abandoned Cart**: Users adding subscriptions to their carts but leaving without finalizing payments.

## Vital Metrics for Checkout Investigation
- **Monthly Checkout Success Rate**: I measured the percentage of successful checkouts compared to monthly attempts, identifying areas of improvement.
- **Monthly Cart Abandonment Rate**: I analyzed the percentage of users who added items to their carts but didn't complete purchases, addressing potential issues.
- **Most Common Checkout Errors and Device Correlations**: I identified checkout errors and device correlations to target tech improvements and enhance the checkout success rate.
